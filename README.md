   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend (Python FastAPI)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
